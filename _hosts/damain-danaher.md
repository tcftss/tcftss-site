An exceprt from Damian's article ["Why You need to See Cloud Atlas"](http://www.ddmag.com.au/film/why-you-need-to-see-cloud-atlas/)

*I long ago came to the decision that far worse than a bad movie was a boring movie. Is there anything more reprehensible than witnessing the expenditure of untold hours of labour, untold millions of dollars and realising at the last that it was so lacking in merit or stimulus that you can’t even recall what you just observed? The one thing I can always say about shitty films is that I remember them afterwards. You have to, otherwise how are you going to complain about them in minute detail to your friends? The same friends who of course won’t believe that said film could possibly be “that bad” and will go to see it anyway, thereby providing a completely misleading box-office haul that the suits-that-be will interpret as a pathological need on the public’s part to consume more of this dreck. I’m as guilty as the next man in this regard. My taste is pretty good but everyone is wrong sometimes and others you just end up falling victim to the irresistible allure of the studio advertising machine.*
