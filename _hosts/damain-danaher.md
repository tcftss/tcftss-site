Film is not a passive medium. It's a reciprocal art-form. It asks us to give to it as much as it gives to us. I firmly believe that there is a symbiotic relationship between the viewer and the film - that if we open ourselves and interrogate what we're watching, the film will reward us with a greater understanding of ourselves and where we stand, both in relation to the reality that the movie constructs but also society at large.

From my own experience, every movie I have ever seen has taught me something about myself. Even if it's on a sub-conscious level, the exploration of how film makes us feel, what it wants to make us feel - and the understanding that the two are often not the same thing - engenders a moment of self-realisation.

That's the mission that Josh and I have set ourselves. It's a grand task and the best thing about it all, is that it will never be done.

We hope you enjoy going on this journey with us.
