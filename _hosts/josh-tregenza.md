There was a time where I barely saw anything on the silver screen. I had gone cold turkey due to an unfortunate affinty to a life as a freelance filmmaker. The only times that I did step into the escape of cinema was when I would get a call from Damian. It would be twenty minuts before the last session time of a film I could vaguely recall. He'd pick me up and he'd play me the latest album of an artist I'd never heard of. Damian took me out of that den of overworking and help stoke the flames of a medium I love so much.

They Came from the Silver Screen is an expression of our mutual love of film and the power film has in our society. Life is different now. I have much more time to enjoy films and regularly came be found in a late night screening, watching the latest obscuria. I've gone from a filmmaker to designer, in fact I do the audio editing and all the design things for the podcast. 

Join us as we venture near and far into our cinephilia.
