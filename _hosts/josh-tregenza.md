For a few years, I barely saw anything on the silver screen. When I did step into a cinema was when I got a call from Damian twenty minutes before a screening of a film I had barely heard of, asking me to join him in the viewing. He'd come pick me up and play me an album I had never heard before. At that point in my life I was too busy to have a social life and any entertainment I could indulge in usually happened whilst I had my head deep in work. Damian took me out of that den of overworking and help stoke the flames of a medium I love so much.

That was when I was a filmmaker. Now that I'm a designer (This site and all the TCFTSS branding is some of the work I do) I have been able to enjoy films more and more, often taking the time to watch films for the hell of it. This podcast is an ode to not only films and our mutual love of them but also of a friendship that heavily involved film.
