There was a time where I rarely saw anything on the silver screen. I was a freelance filmmaker and work got in the way. If not for Damian, I would be stuck at my office instead of broadening my mind by watching other's prowess in film. It would be twenty minutes before the last session time of a film I would be hard pressed to recall. Damian would give me a call, pick me up and would play me the latest album of an artist I had never heard of. Damian took me out of that den of overworking and help stoke the flames of a medium I love so much.

Life is different now. I have much more time to enjoy films and can now be found in a late-night screening, watching the latest obscuria. I've gone from filmmaker to designer, in fact, I do the audio editing and all the design things for the podcast. 

They Came from the Silver Screen is an expression of our mutual love of film and the power film has in our society.

Join us as we venture near and far into our cinephilia.
