synopsis: "We foolishly thought we wouldn't have a lot to talk about with the oscars and Manchester by the Sea, well, proved ourselves wrong. We got into the winners and losers and the topic of Casey Affleck, a point Josh and Damian have some varying opinions on. We also have a guest spot from friend of the show, James Dyke, to help Damian further a point."
