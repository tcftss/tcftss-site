synopsis: "We foolishly thought we wouldn't have a lot to talk about with the oscars and Manchester by the Sea, well, proved ourselves wrong. We got into the winners and losers and the topic of Casey Affleck, a point Josh and Damian have some varying opinions on. We also have a guest spot from friend of the show, James Dyke, to help Damian further a point."
description: "We talk Oscars, the good, the bad and the elephant in the room of Casey Affleck and thus Manchester by the Sea. We get into a lot this episode as a way to see out the end of this cinematic cycle. "
