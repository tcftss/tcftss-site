synopsis: "Jesse (Elle Fanning) moves to Los Angeles just after her 16th birthday to launch a career as a model. The head of her agency tells the innocent teen that she has the qualities to become a top star. Jesse soon faces the wrath of ruthless vixens who despise her fresh-faced beauty. On top of that, she must contend with a seedy motel manager and a creepy photographer. As Jesse starts to take the fashion world by storm, her personality changes in ways that could help her against her cutthroat rivals."
description: "A film about the modelling industry and vampiric pagan cults? Well let's try and unpack the Neon Demon this week. Josh and Damian talk about Winding Refn's latest film and whether it's even good."
