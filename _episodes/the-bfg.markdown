description: "Wow, we made it to 10 episodes, that's certainly a cause for some sort of celebration. What better time to look at the latest film offering from Steven Spielberg, The BFG. An interesting film from the word go, with Spielberg teaming up Disney. We get into this film and wonder who exactly is this film for. "
