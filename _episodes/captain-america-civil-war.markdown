synopsis: "Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man."
description: "We give a critical look at Captain America: Civil War. We talk about  how the film tackles their characters, who works, who doesn't and what they could have done better. We also chat a little about how Marvel is changing  its formulae for the better. Finally, we tackle what Marvel did well and how they tell the same story as WB did with Batman vs Superman and yet made it so much better."
