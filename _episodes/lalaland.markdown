synopsis: "The story of Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a dedicated jazz musician, struggling to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. With modern day Los Angeles as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what is more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight. "
description: "If you enjoyed La La Land, we want to hear from you because we don't get it. Josh and Damian get into the film that has swept the Golden Globes and looks set to take the Academy Awards too. La la Land is a film we don't get, this is one Hollywood pandering, circle jerk that Josh and Damian just can't get behind. "
