synopsis: "A Wall Street stockbroker (Dane DeHaan) travels to a remote location in the Swiss Alps to retrieve his company's CEO (Harry Groener) from an idyllic but mysterious wellness center. He soon suspects that the miraculous treatments are not what they seem. His sanity is tested when he unravels the spa's terrifying secrets and finds himself diagnosed with the same curious illness that keeps all of the guests there longing for a cure."
description: "Eels, Water, Big Shining Aesthetics. Gore Verbinski's latest venture is messed up, gory and intense. The crew form Lone Ranger flex their muscles at doing a real film. Damian and Josh get amongst it and get uncomfortable discussion the film and it's various themes. "
