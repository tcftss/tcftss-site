synopsis: "Disillusioned with the intelligence community, top contractor Edward Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) leaves his job at the National Security Agency. He now knows that a virtual mountain of data is being assembled to track all forms of digital communication -- not just from foreign governments and terrorist groups, but from ordinary Americans. When Snowden decides to leak this classified information, he becomes a traitor to some, a hero to others and a fugitive from the law."
description: "Back from sabbatical, Josh and Damian are back to discuss Snowden, the Oliver Stone biopic about Edward Snowden and the the leanks that occured in 2013. We question whether Stone has become a safe director or is the public more disenfranchised in 2016. We get into a lot of the issues that surround the film and the private citizen privacy.  "
